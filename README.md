## Projects

1. **Dice Roller**
   - A program that simulates rolling a die three times, displaying the results as ASCII art.

2. **Spacecraft and Satellite Distance Calculation**
   - Computes the distance between a spacecraft and a satellite, visualizing the satellite's movement in a circular path.

3. **Prime Number Counter (Basic)**
   - Counts all prime numbers up to 10,000 using a simple method, and measures the elapsed time.

4. **Prime Number Counter (Optimized)**
   - An optimized version of the prime number counter using the square root function to reduce computation time.

5. **Eval Function Tester**
   - Demonstrates the use of the `eval()` function to evaluate user inputs of different data types (int, float, boolean).

6. **Rectangle Drawing with Turtle**
   - Uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a rectangle with different colors for each side.

7. **Spiral and Octagon Drawing with Turtle**
   - Combines Turtle graphics to create a spiral pattern surrounded by an octagon, illustrating the use of loops and geometry.

8. **Simple Function Example**
   - A basic function `double(n)` that returns twice the input number, with explanations on how to call it.

9. **Counting to n**
   - A function that counts from 1 to a user-defined number, utilizing both `for` and `while` loops.

10. **Recursive Counting Example**
   - Demonstrates recursive counting down from `n` and counting up to `n` using loops and a function call.

## Getting Started

To run any of these projects, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (if applicable):
  - `turtle` (usually included with Python)
  - `math`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
