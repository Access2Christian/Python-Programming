## Projects

1. **Dice Roller**
   - A program that simulates rolling a die three times, displaying the results as ASCII art.

2. **Spacecraft and Satellite Distance Calculation**
   - Computes the distance between a spacecraft and a satellite, visualizing the satellite's movement in a circular path.

3. **Prime Number Counter**
   - Counts all prime numbers up to a specified maximum value and measures the time taken to do so.

4. **Eval Function Tester**
   - Demonstrates the use of the `eval()` function to evaluate user inputs of different data types.

5. **Turtle Graphics**
   - Draws shapes and patterns using the Turtle graphics library, including octagons and spirals.

6. **Simple Function Example**
   - A simple function that doubles an input number and explains how to call it from the Python interpreter.

7. **Counting to n**
   - Counts to a user-defined number using both `for` and `while` loops, illustrating function calls in loops.

8. **CSV File Writer**
   - Writes sample data to a CSV file using the `csv` module.

9. **Regular Expressions for Email Extraction**
   - Uses regular expressions to find and extract email addresses from a given string.

10. **Spiral Drawing with Turtle**
    - Combines Turtle graphics with mathematical functions to create a spiral pattern surrounded by an octagon.
